> Markdown for formatting + AsciiMath for math + Latex for the weird stuff

## Examples

This is a basic equation <<1+2*sqrt(2)-pi+alpha/(3.2-1)>>  
More complex things can be done with latex:
$$x\overset{\Bbb{R}}{+} y=x\overset{\Bbb{Q}}{+} y$$
```
Also, it automatically includes several latex libraries such as `amsmath`.

Created as dog food for myself cause I hate latex, use at your own risk.
